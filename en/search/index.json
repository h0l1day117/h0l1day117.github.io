[{"content":"I watched Tron: Legacy twice weeks ago. Here\u0026rsquo;s my review.\nTron: Legacy is a movie about a young man named Sam Flynn, whose dad Kevin Flynn was the CEO of the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest technology company called ENCOM, and the developer of the world\u0026rsquo;s most popular videoarcade game TRON, whose gameplay was 2 players drive their own Light Cycles that can leave a light wall behind them, anyone touched the light wall left by their opponents will lose. Kevin Flynn disappeared in 1989 and nobody knows where he was. 20 years later Sam and his dad\u0026rsquo;s old friend, one of the leader of ENCOM Alan, recieved a page from Kevin\u0026rsquo;s office in his forsaken arcade FLYNN\u0026rsquo;S ARCADE. So Sam went there and went into Kevin\u0026rsquo;s THE GRID world by accident, trying to find out the truth of the mysterious world created by his dad.\nOne night in 1989, Kevin is telling the story of THE GRID to his six-year-old son Sam. He introduced his partners there named TRON and CLU, the former is a brave worrior who fights for users, and the latter is a program in his own image that can think like humans. They built a system where all information is free and open. After that, he goes to work and disappears.\n","date":"2025-04-26T16:43:29+08:00","permalink":"https://h0l1day117.github.io/en/p/tron-legacy-movie-review-wip/","title":"Tron: Legacy movie review (WIP)"},{"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache License 2.0.
